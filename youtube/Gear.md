# My Video Gear Setup

## Camera:
- **Canon EOS M50**
	Going to use this for talking head record.
	Why? Mostly for this video:

- I didn’t decide yet about a webcam for the screencasts or streaming. Going to choose one from the [ideas page][2] or maybe I can buy the [’camlink’][3] by _Elgato_ to use the Canon as webcam.

## Lighting:
**Two DIY Soft-box**
Getting ideas from:
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy7dqPgGdlM][4] (_Spanish_)
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZpjG\_D9fAA][5]

## Tripod:
**Cheap tripod**
Any cheap tripod for camera for now that support until 1kg.

## Microphone:
- **Blue Yeti Nano**
	For screen casting, streaming and video call use.  

- I didn’t decide yet a microphone for the Canon camera. Going to choose one from the [ideas page][6]
