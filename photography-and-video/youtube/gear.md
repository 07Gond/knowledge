## Camera:

* **Canon EOS M50** Going to use this for talking head record. Why? Mostly for this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtLVHXUXNNA&t=1052s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtLVHXUXNNA&t=1052s)
* I didn’t decide yet about a webcam for the screencasts or streaming. Going to choose one from the [ideas page](https://github.com/07Gond/knowledge/tree/c6dc08513afa3ae8236dbf6e5f6a83ec46c8bbee/youtube/Ideas-Accessories.md) or maybe I can buy the [’camlink’](https://www.elgato.com/es/gaming/cam-link-4k) by _Elgato_ to use the Canon as webcam.

## Lighting:

**Two DIY Soft-box** Getting ideas from:

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy7dqPgGdlM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy7dqPgGdlM) \(_Spanish_\\)

## Tripod:

**Cheap tripod** Any cheap tripod for camera for now that support until 1kg.

## Microphone:

* **Blue Yeti Nano** For screen casting, streaming and video call use.
* I didn’t decide yet a microphone for the Canon camera. Going to choose one from the [ideas page](https://github.com/07Gond/knowledge/tree/c6dc08513afa3ae8236dbf6e5f6a83ec46c8bbee/youtube/Ideas-Accessories.md)
