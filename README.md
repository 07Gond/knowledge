Hi! In this place I’m going to publish my knowledge to facilitate to my brain for remember stuff, improve my learning process and share the content with anyone.

If anything here you think is wrong, please don’t hesitate to create an issue on the repository for fix it, that way we can discuss it and learn together. Maybe you can find some grammar errors, please create an issue for fix them.I’m improving my English knowledge too. Thanks for advance.
